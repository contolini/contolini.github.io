I'm an open source [hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture#Definition). I believe technology is a means to an end. I'm still trying to figure out what that end is. I think it has something to do with freedom.

I travel a lot. I roam the country in a tiny ten-foot retrofitted box truck. It has solar panels, running water, and broadband Internet access.

I enjoy building things. I have worked in the not-for-profit sector my entire life. I am currently a Senior Technology and Innovation Fellow at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

I write a lot of JavaScript. I spend a lot of time in the browser. I enjoy helping people. I'm comfortable in most situations.
