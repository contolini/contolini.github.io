I'm an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) developer. I believe technology is a means to an end. I'm still trying to figure out what that end is. I think it has something to do with freedom.

I travel a lot. I live and work from a small ten-foot retrofitted box truck. It has solar panels, running water, and broadband Internet access. I spend most of my time in national forests but I also frequent the Bay Area and Portland, OR.

I enjoy building things. I have worked in the not-for-profit sector my entire life. I currently work full-time as a Senior Technology and Innovation Fellow at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

I write a lot of JavaScript. I spend a lot of time in the browser. I enjoy helping people. I'm comfortable in most situations.
