I bought a [DJI Phantom 3](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013U0F6EQ) over the holidays and even the shaky test footage I shot of some friends looks amazing. You have no idea how excited I am to take this on my travels.

The music in the below video was produced by the father of the little girl featured at the beginning. And, no, BJ is not dead. But it was a lot of fun watching his friends' reactions after posting the video to his Facebook page.
